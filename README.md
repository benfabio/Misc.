Miscellaneous R codes developed here and there

### 04/12/2020
Here, I deposit some R scripts developed since 2013 for various reasons (mapping, data analysis etc.), but mostly to help various friends and colleagues.

I acknowledge these R scripts are not commented in the most detailed fashion. I did not know how to use Git and GitHub backed then. Feel free to contact me at: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch or fabio.benedetti@unibe.ch if you need further information.
